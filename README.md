Directions: Login to the program using test/test or admin/admin as the credentials. From the dashboard, you can add, update, or delete customers and appointments. 
The dashboard displays the customers and appointments in their respective tables. In addition, you can navigate to the reports page to find reports generated about the appointments.

Additional Report: The additional report I chose to create was total appointments by location. Data points about how many appointments are scheduled for a specific location
would be valuable to have when it comes time to expand or move the business in a different direction.
